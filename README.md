Create an efficient (smallest number of operations) sorting algorithm using two stacks data structures.

<br>

Crucial Developer Milestone: Writing sorting algorithms is a fundamental step in a developer's journey, often serving as their first introduction to the concept of computational complexity.

Interview Relevance: Sorting algorithms and their complexities are common and important topics frequently encountered in technical job interviews.

Project Learning Objectives: The key goals of this project are to develop:

    Rigor in approach.
    Proficiency in the C programming language.
    Application of basic algorithms, with a specific emphasis on understanding their complexity.
     

Core Challenge: While sorting values is conceptually simple, determining the fastest (most efficient) sorting method is significantly more complex and depends heavily on the specific arrangement of the data (e.g., the integers being sorted).
